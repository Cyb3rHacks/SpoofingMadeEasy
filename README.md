DNS Spoofing Made Easy with MITMF DNS Module

#NOTE
I am NOT taking credit for the creation of MITMF. I have simply created this python script that uses the DNS module.


DESCRIPTION

SpoofingMadeEasy is a simple script that allows a user to utilise the DNS module of MITMF
Installation:
WiFiBroot heavily depends on scapy. So, you would need scapy installed. Almost, every other library would likely be installed on your system. Make sure the version you install for scapy should be <=2.4.0. Newer versions are likely to throw some unknown errors
